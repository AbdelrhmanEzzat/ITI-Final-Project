Final Project iTi

Application (Hello World) On a Container
Deployed on EKS
The EKS and All the cloud resources applied using Terraform
2 pipelines
1st Pipeline
Infrastructure Pipeline
All the cloud resources applied using Terraform

2nd Pipeline
Application Pipeline
CI/CD Pipeline (Jenkins, Microsoft Azure Pipeline, AWS Code Pipeline)
Deploys Hello World Container on EKS
Preferably Microsoft Azure Pipeline because it is heavily used in the market (Not a bonus just for us)

The First Pipeline (Infrastructure Pipeline) Should Trigger The 2nd Pipeline(Application Pipeline)
